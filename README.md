## 🧭 Overview

This public case study examines the **SSL/TLS configuration** and **HTTP security headers** of a live production domain (`svstudiodesign.com`), conducted with **explicit permission from the owner**.  
The objective was to identify configuration gaps, evaluate security posture against **modern industry standards**, and document the remediation process for **learning and transparency**.

The assessment follows **OWASP**, **NIST**, and **PCI DSS v4.0** guidelines while maintaining a **non-intrusive, ethical approach**.

## ⚙️ Scope & Methodology

**Scope:**  
- SSL/TLS protocol configuration  
- Certificate validation & transparency (SCT, OCSP)  
- Supported cipher suites & forward secrecy  
- HTTP response security headers  

**Out of Scope:**  
- Internal infrastructure  
- Application logic  
- Authentication or intrusive exploitation  

**Tools Used:**  
- `sslyze` (TLS scanning)  
- `nmap` (port/service enumeration)  
- `curl`, `openssl` (header & handshake analysis)  
- `testssl.sh` (TLS simulation & vulnerability checks)  
- Browser DevTools  

**Methodology References:**  
- NIST SP 800-115  
- OWASP Testing Guide v5

## 🔎 Key Findings

| Issue | Severity | Recommendation |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| Missing HSTS header | Medium | Add Strict-Transport-Security |
| Missing CSP header | Medium | Implement a restrictive Content-Security-Policy |
| Missing X-Frame-Options | Low | Add DENY or SAMEORIGIN |
| Missing X-Content-Type-Options | Low | Set to nosniff |
| Missing Referrer-Policy | Low | Add strict-origin or no-referrer |
| OCSP Stapling disabled | Low | Enable stapling in server config |
| Low SCT count (2) | Low | Reissue certificate with ≥3 SCTs |
| 404 on common subpages | Low | Fix or remove broken endpoints |

✅ **TLS 1.2/1.3 supported**  
✅ **Forward Secrecy enabled**  
✅ **Modern cipher suites** (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)  
✅ **No critical vulnerabilities** (e.g., Heartbleed, POODLE, ROBOT)

## 🛠️ Recommended Fixes

Configuration examples for **Apache** and **Nginx** are included in the full report.  
Remediation focuses on achieving an **A+ SSL Labs rating** and aligning with **OWASP A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration**.

## 📊 Compliance Mapping

| Standard | Requirement | Status |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| OWASP Top 10:2021 | A05: Security Misconfiguration | Addressed |
| NIST SP 800-52 Rev. 2 | Strong TLS & cipher usage | Compliant |
| PCI DSS v4.0 | Req. 4: Secure transmission | Compliant |
| NIST SP 800-53 (SC-8) | Transmission integrity | Partially Met |
| GDPR/HIPAA | Encryption for data protection | Compliant |
